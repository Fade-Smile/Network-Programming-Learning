These are study notes for network programming.

Network programming refers to programming implemented through computer networks, which is used for operations such as data exchange, information transmission, and resource sharing between different computers. It involves using programming languages and related tools to write applications that can run on the network to achieve network communication, data transmission, remote access and other functions.

The purpose of network programming is to establish reliable connections that enable computers to communicate with each other and exchange data. This can be achieved through various protocols and technologies such as TCP/IP, HTTP, UDP, etc. In network programming, developers need to understand the basic principles, protocols, and communication methods of network communication in order to create reliable and efficient network applications.

Common network programming tasks include creating server and client applications that implement functions such as data transfer, network security, remote access, and real-time communications. Network programming is widely used in various scenarios such as the Internet, local area networks, client-server systems, and distributed systems.
